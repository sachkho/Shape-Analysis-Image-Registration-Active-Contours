# Medical Imaging Practical Works

This repository contains two practical works (TPs) from a medical imaging course. These projects focus on essential image processing techniques commonly used in medical imaging and computer vision.

## Practical Work 1: Active Contours (Snakes)

### Objective
The goal of this practical work is to implement and experiment with active contour models ("snakes") for image segmentation. This involves:
- Understanding the mathematical foundations of active contours.
- Applying active contour algorithms to extract object boundaries in images.

### Skills Developed
- Image preprocessing and edge detection.
- Implementation of iterative algorithms for contour adjustment.
- Fine-tuning parameters for optimal segmentation results.

### Results
This TP demonstrates how active contours can effectively detect and follow the boundaries of objects in medical images, such as organs or other structures.

## Practical Work 2: Image Registration

### Objective
The objective of this TP is to implement pixel-based image registration algorithms to align two images. This involves:
- Capturing two images of the same object (e.g., a hand) in different positions.
- Aligning these images using registration techniques to demonstrate spatial transformations.

### Skills Developed
- Understanding the concepts of image registration and transformation.
- Coding algorithms to compute image similarity and alignment.
- Debugging and completing partial code provided in the notebook.

### Results
By the end of this TP, you will have implemented a working pipeline to register two images and observed how registration can improve the analysis of multi-modal or temporally varying medical images.
